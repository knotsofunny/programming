Project Euler 


Problem 28
The equation, 16 * n * n + 4 * n + 4, was found using math.
It will find the sum of the four corners of an number spiral size n, not counting the middle square.


Problem 39
The equation, ((-1 * p * p) / ( 2 * (b - p))) - b, was found using math.
It will take a traingle's perimiter, p, and a leg, b, and will output the length of the hypotenuse.
